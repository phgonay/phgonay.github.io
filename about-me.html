                    <p> Hello! My name is Philomène but feel free to call me Philo!</p>
                    <p> As a freelance intercultural and ESD (Education for Sustainable Development) Educator, I am committed to helping people and organizations navigate our intercultural world and make it more sustainable. What really appeals to me about my work is the opportunity to connect with diverse people, observe group dynamics and use creativity for meaningful purposes. I also really appreciate the fact that I can be outside a lot when I work. </p>

        <h2>My background</h2>
        <p> My intercultural experiences go back to my childhood in France. I grew up in a house that was always full of international exchange students. These encoutners awakened my curiosity for the diversity of our world and inspired me early on to explore different cultures. This curiosity led me to spend a year with a host family in Taiwan at the age of 17. This time abroad was formative for my personal development and srengthened my ability to be at ease in different cultural contexts. </p>

    <h2>What did I study?</h2>
    <p> My academic path began with a Bechelor's degree in Philosophy at the Sorbonne University. During this degree, I spent a year at the University of Toronto. My philosophical focus was on language philosophy and environmental ethics.My interest in environmental questions stems from my philosophical studies, where I reflected on moral implications of environmental challenges. This self-reflection led to combine my personal values with concrete steps toward a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
    <p> When I came back to Europe I moved to Germany and started later on a second Bechelor's degree in Education Sciences at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU). There I also followed an extra certificate programm "el mundo" on Education for Sustainable Development. Additionally I took part in a training of the French-German Youth Office (FGYO) on intercultural youth work. During this time at the LMU I had the chance, as part of my Bachelor's thesis, to develop a personal project: the creation of a a board game to inform on sustainabl develoment (s.   <a href="game-development.html">Game developpment</a>.). This project reflects my commitment to innovatice and ineractive learning methods. By combining my values with my passion for working with people, I have commited myself to a career path that combies purpose and joy. </p>
