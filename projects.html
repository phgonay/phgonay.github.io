                        <p>As part of a German-French exchange on the topic of major sport events and urban development, organized by dock europe e.V., a workshop was offered on the topics of the Olympic Games and sustainability. The workshop took place in Hamburg and was held in two languages: French and German, with simultaneous translation. The participants had the opportunity to learn about the existing international development goals after working on the development of their ideal city. They discovered that sustainability encompasses many areas that are all interconnected. Based on this knowledge, they were invited to reflect on the pros and cons of the Olympic Games in the context of sustainability and urban development. Methods such as the SDGs network and the writing conversation were used in the workshop.</p>

                        <p>As part of a project day at a secondary school in Munich with the motto “We are strong because we are different”, I offered the workshop “Diversity is sustainable!” on the topic of social sustainability: This workshop covered various topics, including the general meaning of sustainability and the connection of diversity and other social issues with sustainability. The pupils had the opportunity to discuss the extent to which their school is already socially sustainable and were able to formulate wishes for a stronger culture of diversity at their school. Activities on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a school detective game were used as methods.</p>

                        <p>For the Caritas, I offered a training course on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) for employees of a daycare center: Various topics were covered, including the importance of ESD, the Whole Institution Approach and the implementation of a Whole Kindergarten Approach. The individual environment and the daycare center's network were also analyzed in order to use existing resources and develop future changes. The project included team discussions about fears and hopes regarding the sustainable development of the kindergarten. Motivational and creative methods were used, some of which also served as examples for activities with children and were accompanied by pedagogical reflection.</p>
